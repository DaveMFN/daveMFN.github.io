- ## My Interests
- 1. Learning/doing/trying new stuff (**see #2 below**).
  2. Having fun doing it!
- ## Websites I recommend
- 1. My second favorite website really is [Google.](www.google.com), although it's typically the first place I go on the web.
  2. The site I choose over any other if all others disappeared is [**YouTube University**](https://www.youtube.com).
   Trust, I have logged more time on that site than all others combined.
